<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>
This site is hosted on a server that avoids caching because content is in development and may change rapidly.<br>
Sometimes, content will still end up cached by your browser and new content will not be visible or some elements will appear distorted or other style/layout issues will occur.<br>
If this occurs, please try the following:
<ol>
  <li>refresh the page several times</li>
  <li>clear the browser cache manually</li>
  <li>visit the site in private mode</li>
  <li>try a different web browser</li>
  <li>contact your developer or flat18 directly if none of the above steps works</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
<p>
  This is a bespoke design and build -customary for flat18 projects.<br>
  The front end is written in minimal shorthand and uses expressive naming to make function maintenance easy.
  <br>Installation should also be straightforward thanks to the simple data-model.
</p>

<h3>The data model</h3>
<p>
  Multiple redundancies are written into the UI handling, however the majority of the data labels and objects are essential to the UI creation flow.
  The sample data is included in the src folder which is available via a direct url (for quick inspection) or in the project repository.
</p>

<h3>The design system</h3>
<p>
  This is a bespoke design system which utilises a simple colour scheme and is designed `dark-first` with priority given to darker colour schemes. Colours used are vibrant, saturated and complimented by muted, soft, powdery shades of the primary colour.
</p>
<p>We use our signature whitespace, bold padding and large headings to create a clean and pleasant layout with subtle and effective transitions and build animations.</p>

<h2>Notes to the Backend Dev</h2>

<p>This site is built using a single-page approach which is an experimental method to reduce crawling and robots by making fewer actual, or server-acknowledged directories and subfolders. You may choose to change this model when installing the site. Be sure to replicate the necessary frontend javascript on the pages which require it and make use of the modular design of the html to create templates accordingly.</p>
